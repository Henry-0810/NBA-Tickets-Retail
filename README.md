# NBA-Tickets-Retail-System
I developed a comprehensive Basketball ticket System as a personal project, utilizing my skills in C#, the.NET Framework, and Oracle SQL Developer. The system aimed to streamline the ticketing process for basketball matches by providing a user-friendly interface for customers to purchase tickets, process returns, and assign seats based on seat types with additional analysis after a certain number of sales.

By leveraging C# and .NET Framework, I ensured a robust and scalable system that could handle a high volume of transactions efficiently. The integration of Oracle SQL Developer allowed for seamless database management and optimized data retrieval and storage.

This project not only showcased my technical expertise in software development but also demonstrated my ability to analyze complex requirements and deliver a user-friendly solution. It reinforced my skills in system design, database management, and problem-solving.

Overall, the Basketball Tickets System stands as a testament to my proficiency in C#, .NET Framework, and Oracle SQL Developer, as well as my dedication to creating innovative solutions that enhance user experiences and drive business efficiency.
